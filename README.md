## Instructions for Using SnapIt: 📸

1. 📌 Open the command palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+P (OS X).
2. 🔍 Search for "SnapIt" in the command palette and select it.
3. 🖱️ Choose the code you want to capture as a screenshot.
4. 📏 Adjust the width of the screenshot if desired.
5. 💾 Click the shutter button to save the screenshot to your disk.

**Tips: 💡**

- You can also start SnapIt by selecting the code, right-clicking, and clicking on the SnapIt option.
- If you'd like to assign a hotkey for SnapIt, go to your keyboard shortcut settings and bind the "snapit.launch" action to a custom key combination.
- If you prefer to copy the screenshot to the clipboard instead of saving it, simply click on the image and use the copy keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+C on Windows/Linux, Cmd+C on OS X). You can also customize this feature by binding the "snapit.launch" action to the copy command in your settings. 📋✂️
